•The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row. You play on a three by three game board.
• The first player is known as X and the second is O. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either oppent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled.
• X always goes first, and in the event that no one has three in a row, the stalemate is called a cat game.
